# Data-Labeler-Project
The concept for this project was to make a data labeler using PyQt5 but make it work for my Astronomy class as my creative project.
The idea came to me as a interaction between the professor and the class for a specific part of the lecture. Since we were
forced to be online during COVID interactions during the week was difficult. Every lecture started off with the
"Astronomy Picture of the Day" which was an image posted by NASA on their webpage. 

The professor would get the image and label it using the interface. The students would get the image and the annotations files. They
would click on the image and select the correct button to identify the label. Basically the data labeler work like how a multiple choice
quiz would function.

The project works and I am adding the functionally to it that was missing during the semester that I wanted as well as creating a stand-alone
data labeler for practical use.

## TODO for repo
- [ ] Create folders for the versions of the labeler in different folders
- [x] Add current project to the Git Repo for illustration
- [ ] Embedded the images into the README

## TODO for the Astronomy Class project deliverable
- [ ] Add feedback system to the client (student) version of the code
- [ ] Add label file encoder and decoder to prevent the student from looking at the answer
- [ ] Save the student score to a document and add a current grade indication within the GUI
- [ ] Fix edge cases for user error or GUI interactions

## TODO for stand-alone version
- [ ] Allow for selection of folder locations for images and labels
- [ ] Create a way to cycle labels and images within the GUI
- [ ] Create an undo button
- [ ] Fix edge cases for user error or GUI interactions (same as above)
